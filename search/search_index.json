Do hospital admission rates and safety outcomes differ by age, sex and ethnic groups? Objective Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the assessment of patients presenting to Emergency Departments with possible acute myocardial infarction across the United Kingdom in order to identify areas of variation in practice and opportunities for quality improvement. Population of Interest Consecutive patients age 18 years or older at presentation who present to the Emergency Department or Acute Medicial Receiving Unit with possible myocardial infarction to any participating hospital for a 12 month period from October 2021 to October 2022 will be included within the study. Patients with possible myocardial infarction are identified if they have at least one measurement of cardiac troponin performed within 24 hours of attendance and will be eligible for inclusion. Patients will be excluded if they do not have an NHS number (England) or Community Health Index (CHI) number in Scotland to enable linkage. Primary Efficacy Outcome The proportion of patients discharged directly from the Emergency Department Primary Safety Endpoint Myocardial infarction or cardiac death within 30 days from discharge Secondary Endpoints Duration of index hospital stay Any reattendance within 30 days of discharge Myocardial infarction within 30 days of discharge Cardiac death within 30 days of discharge Cardiovascular death within 30 days of discharge All cause death within 30 days of discharge Coronary angiography during index presentation or within 30 days of discharge Coronary revascularisation during index presentation or within 30 days of discharge Analysis Plan {TBA} Reporting and Outputs {TBA} Reference Website layout mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The index page documentation.md # An explanation of the project documentation data_models.md # The data model specs for the project code.md # Codeshares and docstrings guides.md # Guides modules/ {to be added}","title":"Index"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-hdruk-chest-pain-collaboration-docs","text":"This is a collection of the docs for the project and code snippets to help us all collaborate and share tools.","title":"Welcome to the HDRUK Chest Pain Collaboration Docs"},{"location":"#site-main-sections","text":"index - This navigation page documentation - Documentation for the project which can be published open source to encourage sharing data_models - Contains the Details of the Data Models for the project code - Share repository for code snippets and explanation of how various parts of the code work guides - Guides for how to set things up for the project","title":"Site Main Sections"},{"location":"#study-questions","text":"Does regional variation in the use of early rule out pathways for patients with possible myocardial infarction impact on healthcare utilization and patient safety?
