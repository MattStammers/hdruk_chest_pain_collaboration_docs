# HDRUK Chest Pain Collaboration Documentation

Repository for sharing data models and information for the national HDRUK chest pain project

This is the main repo. Feel free to create code development branches and submit pull requests to update the documentation. If this works and matures we can move it to the official HDRUK repository.
